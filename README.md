## 🧠 How It Works

Each platform is checked using its public profile URL pattern:

| Platform  | Profile URL                                                                        | Method | Meaning                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Twitter   | [https://twitter.com/{username}](https://twitter.com/{username})                   | GET    | 200 → Taken, 404 → Available |
| Instagram | [https://instagram.com/{username}/](https://instagram.com/{username}/)             | GET    | 200 → Taken, 404 → Available |
| Telegram  | [https://t.me/{username}](https://t.me/{username})                                 | GET    | 200 → Taken, 404 → Available |
| Snapchat  | [https://www.snapchat.com/add/{username}](https://www.snapchat.com/add/{username}) | GET    | Uses text & status check     |

The app respects delays between requests (configurable) to avoid rate limits.
